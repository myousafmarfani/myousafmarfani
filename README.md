# Hi, I'm M. Yousuf 👋

Full-Stack Developer | AI & ML Enthusiast | Spec-Driven Development Advocate

Currently learning Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Agentic AI with hands-on experience in building full-stack applications and AI-powered systems using specification-driven methodologies.

## 🚀 What I'm Working On

**Evolution of Todo - GIAIC Hackathon II:**
- **Phase I (Completed):** Python console app with in-memory task management using Claude Code
- **Phase II (Completed):** Full-stack web app with Next.js, FastAPI, SQLModel, and Neon PostgreSQL
- **Phase III (Completed):** AI-powered chatbot using OpenAI Agents SDK and MCP server architecture
- **Phase IV (In Progress):** Local Kubernetes deployment with Docker, Minikube, and Helm charts
- **Phase V (In Progress):** Cloud deployment on DigitalOcean with Kafka, Dapr, and event-driven architecture

All phases built using spec-driven development with documented specifications, plans, and tasks before implementation.

## 💡 My Development Philosophy

I believe in **Spec-Driven Development** over vibe coding. Every project starts with comprehensive specifications, detailed planning, and documented prompts. Using tools like **Speckit** and **Claude Code**, I build web applications and AI systems with:

- 📋 **Clear Specifications** - Every feature documented before implementation
- 📐 **Structured Planning** - Tasks broken down into actionable steps
- 📝 **Prompt Documentation** - All AI interactions and decisions tracked
- ⚙️ **Rule-Based Implementation** - Code follows defined standards and patterns

This approach ensures maintainability, scalability, and clear communication across all projects.

## 🎯 Development Approach

My workflow follows a systematic, specification-first methodology:

1. **📋 Specification** - Define clear requirements and system architecture
2. **📐 Planning** - Break down features into detailed tasks and milestones
3. **📝 Documentation** - Document all prompts, decisions, and implementation steps
4. **⚡ Implementation** - Build according to specifications with AI-assisted development
5. **✅ Validation** - Ensure deliverables match the original spec

Every line of code has a purpose, every feature has a plan, and every decision is documented.

## 🤝 Open to Collaborate

I'm interested in collaborating on:
- Open-source AI agent projects built with specification-first methodologies
- Multi-agent systems for real-world applications with documented workflows
- Full-stack web apps integrating ML models using structured development practices
- Projects that value clear documentation and systematic planning
